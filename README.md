## Project Focus  

This project aims to develop and highlight expertise in the following SQL techniques:  

- **Advanced Joins and Aggregations**: Executing intricate SQL joins and aggregating data to extract valuable insights.  
- **Window Functions**: Leveraging advanced window functions for computing running totals, analyzing growth trends, and conducting time-based queries.  
- **Data Segmentation**: Examining data across different time periods to evaluate product performance effectively.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Utilizing SQL functions to explore relationships between variables, such as the impact of product pricing on warranty claims.
